Build a form builder UI that allows users to create a JSON Schema visually instead of writing JSON manually.

Users should be able to:

- Add new form fields dynamically
- Set a field name (used as the JSON key)
- Choose a field type from predefined options (text, number, date, dropdown, boolean, etc.)
- Mark whether the field is required or optional
- Configure additional options when relevant (e.g. dropdown options)

After all fields are configured, the system should automatically generate a valid JSON Schema that represents the defined form structure.
